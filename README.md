# Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

A machine learning demonstration that compares Logistic Regression and Random Forest on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset through a FastAPI + React interface.

## Overview

This project implements a full-stack web application for diabetes prediction using machine learning. The application allows users to input medical parameters and receive predictions from two different ML models.

## Dataset

Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Features: 8 medical predictor variables
- Target: Binary outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)
- Samples: 768 instances

### Features
1. Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)
3. Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age: Age (years)

## Models

### Logistic Regression
- Simple, interpretable baseline model
- Fast training and prediction
- Linear decision boundary

### Random Forest
- Ensemble learning method
- Better performance on non-linear patterns
- Feature importance analysis

## Model Performance

### Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: 0.7143
- Precision: 0.6087
- Recall: 0.5185
- F1-Score: 0.56
- ROC-AUC: 0.823

### Random Forest
- Accuracy: 0.7597
- Precision: 0.6809
- Recall: 0.5926
- F1-Score: 0.6337
- ROC-AUC: 0.8147

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- FastAPI: Modern Python web framework
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library
- pandas: Data manipulation
- numpy: Numerical computing

### Frontend
- React: UI library
- Tailwind CSS: Styling
- Axios: HTTP client
- Shadcn/UI: Component library

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 16+
- yarn package manager

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Access Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8001
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8001/docs

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/models/metrics
Returns performance metrics for both models

### POST /api/predict
Makes predictions using both models

Request body:
```json
{
  "pregnancies": 6,
  "glucose": 148,
  "blood_pressure": 72,
  "skin_thickness": 35,
  "insulin": 0,
  "bmi": 33.6,
  "diabetes_pedigree_function": 0.627,
  "age": 50
}
```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser
2. View model performance metrics at the top
3. Enter patient medical data in the form
4. Click "Predict" to get predictions from both models
5. View results showing prediction outcomes and probabilities
6. Use "Reset" to clear the form and start over

## Evaluation notes

The published metrics are from a single stratified 80/20 train-test split with a fixed random seed. They are useful for demonstrating the workflow, but they are **not clinical validation** and should not be interpreted as production or diagnostic performance.

Feature preprocessing is fitted only on the training split. Input validation on the API enforces reasonable bounds before inference.

## Important Notes

- No LLM (Large Language Model) is used for predictions
- All predictions are made using traditional machine learning algorithms
- Models are trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
- Predictions are session-based and not stored in database
- This is an educational project for demonstration purposes
- Not intended for actual medical diagnosis

## Results

On the documented hold-out split, Random Forest demonstrates higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 than Logistic Regression:
- 4.5% higher accuracy
- Better precision and recall
- Slightly lower ROC-AUC but better overall classification

Both models show reasonable performance for diabetes prediction, with Random Forest performing better on this particular hold-out split.
